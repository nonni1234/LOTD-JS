    $$I've been spending nights working 'til the morning
The morning, yeah
Only reason I have is 'cause I see something they don't, yeah
They don't, yeah, ayy
I been getting heat like crazy
They be telling me I'm crazy, ayy
I need so much me time lately
That's why every beat back crazy

Ever since this shit started, felt like things often my mental
I never felt like I'm doing enough of what I am meant to
Went and hired some help like fifty said in '03
I worked my way out that hell now all I'm left with is heat in different ways
'Cause I can go and give you something you could vibe to
Mindless ear candy, hidden message you could find
Two weeks go by, drop some other shit that changed your life
Who told you not to try? You should beat his ass
Every two weeks, that's a plan
Bitch, I'm an artist, I need to my music jelly it jam
My brain keep dumping, I reload
I'm different, homie, I'm him, consistent hitters
They judge me, I'm airing (aaron) out
Whoever's hating ass talk down on me
But for now I've been

I've been spending nights working 'til the morning
The morning, yeah
Only reason I have is 'cause I see something they don't, yeah
They don't, yeah, ayy
I been getting heat like crazy
They be telling me I'm crazy, ayy
I need so much me time lately
That's why every beat back crazy

Ayy, I had to let go and let be, this is me
All or nothin', heart straight layin' on my sleeve
Music speaks, talk somethin'
We all gamblin' with time, I'm never blind
Small budges do it all 'cause I like tryin'
If I fail, ah, fuck it
That's what make it all worthwhile, won't ever change me
Needed time with my thoughts, piled up 'til I can't breathe
Now me again, at least that's how I feel like, fuck the other shit
The floods coming, this is real life, heads up

I've been spending nights working 'til the morning
The morning, yeah
Only reason I have is 'cause I see something they don't, yeah

Cause it be speaking to they souls
This is a classic
Sick of fighting with you bums, work my craft, watch you laugh
As long as momma likes this song, this is a classic

I've been on a new wave, no hit, classic
Going on for two days, floating, magic
Sage lit, got the bass hitting and I'm tapped in
Tryna change the world, this the bullshit before you step in
I let you be the judge, I get plenty in the tank
Give the music to the world and hope the jury gets me paid
This ain't for me, I'm bring Jersey when I break
Just because I had this flow, leaving frozen like Russian banks
This ironic, all the doors they slammed on me I record it
Turn them into snares for beats that makes the songs that take me over
Talk about a plot twist, fuck the fame
You can't hang that over my head, I'm just here to bring realness to what you spoiled, damn

And I ain't saying that we perfect
But we damn close, I must say
And let em' tell us we ain't worth shit (Why?)

Senior year of high school, I was sitting front of class
Walked up to my math teacher, told him I'ma miss the next
Couple days of school, I'm flying to LA because my raps
Make a face like I was joking in [?] of the whole class can hear him
Laughing, why he said, "You better hope this pays the bills, though"
Sounds like someone had a dream they never chased and still cold
To be honest, those the types of people I don't feel for
I just think he mad his wife gets more pleasure from her dildo
I don't care about a goddamn thing, you ain't shit
Watch for when I cop the droptop range and lane switch
And I ain't saying this the reason that this chip sit on my shoulder
But he showed me how it looks when you quit before it's over

Used to break my soul, I just played the bluff
Having you thinking I fold
I got so much left to do, just get money, [unintelligible]
And now I might leave the stu' and tell my family that we cool (Ayy)

This is a classic, ayy

    $$Used to let it rock, now it's too much
Feel like we on different sides because one of us is growing
Crossing every line that I drew, yeah
Jealousy is in your eyes and it's showing
I be damned if I let anyone show
Show me all the signs if someone I don't want close
And it's hurting my soul
I honestly don't want to let go

Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now
Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now, yeah

It's hard for me to watch you dealing cope with insecurities
Like putting people down to feed the ego but it's hurting
The ones you calling over when you home but I know certainly
The second we ain't close, you going ghost, I read you thoroughly
I know you got some demons upstairs
But you never open up because you scared, I know
But I promise you don't really know fear
Just imagine because of you, we ain't here, oh no
But it's got to that, now we thought to
Back when we was playing ball and every single shot of cash
You was mad cause shit that small would move the spotlight off of that
And we was running bigger games, you play like five rings on your hand
Cause you all about that competition
Well if you want it like you talk it, then fine let's get it
Don't music give my face because you know my chests got commas in it
Act like you have before me but show me deep down you prayin' (Ayy), ehh

Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now

I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now, yeah

You was in my corner, now you praying on my downfall
OG told me, "Watch my circle the more I count em"
Mines ain't never wrong, now I show em' to clear the past now
Facing this means cutting off ties cause I know this is bad for my
State of mind, watching every set cause you been sneak dissing
Throw dirt on my name because you hate the fact that my teeth glistening
Happy dreams I'm folding cause I grind and for these seat
I sit in beige leather, a top ten, either way I see it, I'm winning
You don't know what this life, but I could teach you to get it
You pride too high to hide, you rather hate me then be winning
But I don't want to give any more time
Hurts the heart of my soul and mind and

I be damned if I let anyone show
Show me all the signs if someone I don't want close
And it's hurting my soul
I honestly don't want to let go (Ayy)

    $$The money is stackin'
I been in the lab getting shots, about practice
Guess that's the reaction
You fall off the quickest, we blow up the fastest
Good thing I've been active, I been on my hustle, my bully my Casper
'Cause I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho
All I'm seein' is one comma, I need three of that
Two could do me plenty, every penny came from these hands
I don't really fuck with gossip, I don't need that
So I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho

Cryin' in tears and one day I'mma say we're the ones that I cried, that done got me this far
Ain't even trying still spit with a climate to highest and fire from here to the stars
When you this high, you get lonely, still I never found no coffee
She want me treat her like Rosie, put a ring around her finger
She usually like to move slowly
All eyes on me, cameras on me, farther I see then the farther I'm runnin'
If you with me, it's all in a leaf, you ain't ballin' if you ain't giving nothin'
It's why we ain't making room, no time to wait for you, uh-uh
We known to break the rules, I just tell fate to choose and I pray that

The money is stackin'
I been in the lab getting shots, about practice
Guess that's the reaction
You fall off the quickest, we blow up the fastest
Good thing I've been active, I been in my hustle, my bully my Casper

Two could do me plenty, every penny came from these hands
I don't really fuck with gossip, I don't need that
So I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho (Look)

Isolated, never jaded, I pray that the blessin's go all around
I don't need Lasik, to see they fakin', but send her my love, like feel shawty now
Your foot on the brake and you stallin', everybody movin' forward
Back in my mind where I leave you, but I know I'll never gon' need ya
So I will not say shit, when we touch down
We don't even ever have to talk but I'm sittin' on your playlist
Turn it up loud, barely catch me at the club 'cause I'm busy chasin' bucks
From the basement, to a bussdown
Where it's going but it ain't yet, it's a flood now
Let em' all say shit, gives a fuck about anything you say
Cause baby what now— and the-the-the-the

The money is stackin'

What would I do if the world kept going but I ain't get you?
Probably down bad, no future in my lens
Had me imagining kids in the yard with a view
Knew to always let God do the work for me
Let Him be to do His job, then He started coming
Happened slow from where we started, nеver saw it coming
'Cause look at wherе the fuck we are, baby we really does it
I don't really mean to flex on rest of the world
But you stay through the test, you invest in my girl
Hoodie, hair up, put some sweat in you, girl
And the way you fit your dress putting stress in them girls
That's the way it got to be sometime

Hard times could do, I'm fine

Eyes get perked up at the thought of you next to me
I'm gon' protect the two, ain't no neglecting you
I learned my lesson, move steady on steady
I put all my faith into you, now I'm facing the truth
It's a feeling I don't like to feel
I'm known to break and lose anything stable through
All of the problems I keep to myself
Fucked up so many times and you let it go
Understand I never been good with love
But I give my time and you know I try
And it's the one thing you looking for
And you know if you bawling and crying
You call me, I'm siding
Give to you all that
I've gotten from you and more, because

If I call you, I know you gon' pick up

It's 2 a.m. in a city you can't get to
Unless you rollin' with me
Said you don't want me 'cause you don't understand my mental
So why you comin' to me?
Why you thinkin' that we friends? Just get out
Drama in your life, don't give a damn
Yeah, I been letting too much out for a minute
Now you need advice I keep it zipped

Wonder how you felt, they just bait you 'til they reel you in
AK somethin' else, you ain't shit except a meal to him
I know longer feel so it's killed from belittlement
Had me on my heels 'til I found out you was the little man
Ain't nothing in between me and the game
Except you, fuck trippin'
Stayin' in my way, why you stay in lane too?
I'm fucking phenomenal, I'm buggin' and found them tools in my head
They made me unstoppable so I ain't gossipin' with grown men
All I need is a microphone and that's it
You're a son to me, I rock you like you wearin' a [?]
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends

Everybody wanna be something except real
Never could comprehend why people live letting stress build
If you hit me with drama then you blocked anonymous
Actin' like we're friends, I know how you speaking behind my back
So why the fuck am I the one to call? You got it wrong
Keep the petty bullshit to yourself, you got it all
Twisted, let me get a simple minute of your time
I'ma show you somethin' different might just change your fucking life
Ego on a high horse, start lettin' my pride go
Was letting my circle down from praising the most high, to being the high most
Tryna chill now on the weed so I gotta keep the bud light
Never took a bean but Chicago on a long flight but now it's

2 a.m. in a city that you can't get to
Unless you rollin' with me (Rollin' with me)
Said you don't want me 'cause you don't understand my mental

Why you thinkin' that we friends? Just get out
Drama in your life, don't give a damn
Yeah, I been letting too much out for a minute
Now you need advice I keep it zipped

The problem why so few of us make permanent changes is because we put the pressure on trying to change seven different areas. And you ain't gonna do it. Permanent changes don't work if you do seven different things at a time. Permanent changes work if you do one thing at a time.$$

You just stay up in your lane 'cause this a different roadway
No forgiveness for the gimmicks you tried playing, no way
Bunch of sloppy carbon copies, put 'em all in cold graves (Ayy, look)

Sometimes gotta move different switches flipping on
You can hate it or love it, the underdog gon' bе on top

And it gets so hard when you don't think alike with those that you brought on to the team, I might

Made me feel brainless, now it's real dangerous
When I look at the clock and I see all the time spent here, been a while and it hurts me to see
Dollar signs on my mind never what it's about something changed me a lot but I'm working on me
Used to be more confident in my vision, now I hate everything I think I believe
Now I'm hard on myself, lost in this hell, think I can't be shit if I move how I see

Get up in my way, they all keep saying that I'm trying to
Do too much because they know they sheep and I'm a lion to 'em
Biggest threat they ever seen, intimidation at its finest

They pride won't let 'em walk away so i jump in and annihilate

Classic intervention, we got things to discuss
Only your problems stemming from you not believing your gut
And that ain't on me, I say that 'cause I feel you projecting

    $$I cherish how far we've come, sometime my thoughts in the past
Apartment 1719, me, Todd, my mom, it ain't past five yet
So pops is working, got his foot on the gas
Tryna get us up out of there, give us new views on new paths
Now at the time, uh, I was only like five
But flashbacks be way too vivid, they ingrained in my mind
Watching [?] Mom and Dad watching me from outside
Through the back door on the deck where they spent lots of they time
Cigarettes would fill they chest with plenty more than just smoke
Use it to cope with the stress that come when you start losing hope
I knew that shit was bad for 'em, but again I was five
Yeah, ignorance is bliss but now I see the reason behind
The deeper meanings of everything, all the reasons they did
Anything they ever did like having kids while they kids
Early twenties, they was hustling, can't imagine the pressure
That my father must have felt but never felt he was never the type
To hear a word no and say, "Aight, like, whatever"
If he saw it in his mind, best believe he gon' get a
Little piece for himself, bring the family some too
And everybody knew that that's exactly what he's gon' do
And then he did it

We moved to a new house, my little sister was born
I remember I got a red X Games bike for Christmas and shit
I was on cloud nine as a kid, you know what I'm saying?

I was in third grade at school, a kid was talking 'bout his mom and dad
He said he don't want to leave and go home 'cause his mom was mad
And last night he said he watched his pops get in the cab
That his mama called and pulled up to his crib and his father left
My curiosity was eating at me, couldn't even imagine
My parents were so in love, no way for me that's what happened
Felt bad but needed to ask him while he thinks that it happened
He said neither of them happy, been fighting for years, it's tragic
Lunchtime, I sat alone, that wasn't like me
But my mind was spinning, I'm thinking how my parents been fighting
More than usual, I seen coffee pots fly and shatter on the walls
I was feeling doomed and it moved me to tears
I drank my little carton of milk
And prayed to God that nothing that kid just told me was real
But in my heart I had a feeling only time would reveal
My newest biggest fear would come to life, my body in chills
One night, me and my brother Todd were playing basketball
The hoop was on the door at the top, our parents arguing
They voices raising like dried grapes in a box
Was used to it, but this time just felt like something was off
And then we heard, "Todd and Austin, come downstairs"
Started walking, heart was racing, knew what we 'boutta hear
Sat us on the couch, they looked and paused, eyes filled with tears
They told us both they splitting up, divorce was set for next year, damn

See God had blessed me with a life where I had both of my parents
Ended up leaving each other but planned so time can be shared, it's
Fifty-fifty custody, Monday and Tuesday was Mom's
Wednesdays and Thursday was Pops'
Fridays and weekends switched off
And although it was hard, that shit created a bond
Between me and each of my parents individually, I saw
How they's affected by it everyday, mama tryna make some pay
Food upon the plate [?] go ahead and make 'em play
It's funny how then, every day felt like a rainy day
Till we control the rain with money guns, load 'em and let 'em spray
It's crunch time, all about the crunch time
How you use your chip on your shoulder but never hunch down
Staying true to why you do it with no fear, being on the front lines
Dad crazy enough to chase his dream, so what's mine?
Rewind, yeah, we climb, they say it's all 'cause me, nah
Tryna take y'all back to times I hold close but I left behind

See when we were back in the apartment before his invention took off
My dad was working so much at this blue-collar job
But he had dreams and used his self-taught knowledge
And the pressure of survival that he grew up with to his advantage
And he did something beautiful for himself as a man
And now being the age that he was
Back when he had a whole-ass family to take care of and provide for
I can't understand how he did it
But I see similarities in mine in his story

Started writing in my notes app on my phone with it
Thumbs moving like they do now with the blue notes and shit
Early on I was writing songs and I done rolled some hits
Before that money, all these things that caused those who was close to switch
And I don't trip but I think of pops working them overshifts
He had a dream, did everything to get closer to what he visioned in his mind
Working at it through lunch breaks at [?]
Only place he had the tools to bring to life the things he saw in his mind
That dirty workshop was his booth, the pen he used the same as mine
Both writing down every idea beyond the space between the lines
It's hard to see and understand when you got a unique mind
Feel you're always a step ahead leading people that sheep blind
Even with bullshit going on, you find yourself back to the grind
'Cause you know eventually you'll make it out, just give it time
Try different things, roll with the punches, never know what you gon' find
My pops really been through it all, good and bad and he stay smiling$$
