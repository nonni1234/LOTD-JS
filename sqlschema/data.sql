"You don't make permanent changes, you always make temporary changes. It's mathematically impossible for you to think that life is dramatically going to change by you making temporary changes. It's not, it's the permanent changes.

It's 2 a.m. in a city you can't get to
Unless you rollin' with me
Said you don't want me 'cause you don't understand my mental
So why you comin' to me?
Why you thinkin' that we friends? Just get out
Drama in your life, don't give a damn
Yeah, I been letting too much out for a minute
Now you need advice I keep it zipped

Wonder how you felt, they just bait you 'til they reel you in
AK somethin' else, you ain't shit except a meal to him
I know longer feel so it's killed from belittlement
Had me on my heels 'til I found out you was the little man
Ain't nothing in between me and the game
Except you, fuck trippin'
Stayin' in my way, why you stay in lane too?
I'm fucking phenomenal, I'm buggin' and found them tools in my head
They made me unstoppable so I ain't gossipin' with grown men
All I need is a microphone and that's it
You're a son to me, I rock you like you wearin' a [?]
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
James Webb can't even see half as far as I'm headed but now it's

2 a.m. in a city you can't get to
Unless you rollin' with me (Rollin' with me)
Said you don't want me 'cause you don't understand my mental
So why you comin' to me? (Comin' to me)
Why you thinkin' that we friends? Just get out
Draw me in your life, don't give a damn
Yeah, I been letting too much out for a minute
Now you need advice I can't present

Everybody wanna be something except real
Never could comprehend why people live letting stress build
If you hit me with drama then you blocked anonymous
Actin' like we're friends, I know how you speaking behind my back
So why the fuck am I the one to call? You got it wrong
Keep the petty bullshit to yourself, you got it all
Twisted, let me get a simple minute of your time
I'ma show you somethin' different might just change your fucking life
Ego on a high horse, start lettin' my pride go
Was letting my circle down from praising the most high, to being the high most
Tryna chill now on the weed so I gotta keep the bud light
Never took a bean but Chicago on a long flight but now it's

2 a.m. in a city that you can't get to
Unless you rollin' with me (Rollin' with me)
Said you don't want me 'cause you don't understand my mental
So why you comin' to me? (Comin' to me)
Why you thinkin' that we friends? Just get out
Drama in your life, don't give a damn
Yeah, I been letting too much out for a minute
Now you need advice I keep it zipped

The problem why so few of us make permanent changes is because we put the pressure on trying to change seven different areas. And you ain't gonna do it. Permanent changes don't work if you do seven different things at a time. Permanent changes work if you do one thing at a time."),

(1,"Lemme Find Out",
"Used to let it rock, now it's too much
Feel like we on different sides because one of us is growing
Crossing every line that I drew, yeah
Jealousy is in your eyes and it's showing
I be damned if I let anyone show
Show me all the signs if someone I don't want close
And it's hurting my soul
I honestly don't want to let go

Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now
Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now, yeah

It's hard for me to watch you dealing cope with insecurities
Like putting people down to feed the ego but it's hurting
The ones you calling over when you home but I know certainly
The second we ain't close, you going ghost, I read you thoroughly
I know you got some demons upstairs
But you never open up because you scared, I know
But I promise you don't really know fear
Just imagine because of you, we ain't here, oh no
But it's got to that, now we thought to
Back when we was playing ball and every single shot of cash
You was mad cause shit that small would move the spotlight off of that
And we was running bigger games, you play like five rings on your hand
Cause you all about that competition
Well if you want it like you talk it, then fine let's get it
Don't music give my face because you know my chests got commas in it
Act like you have before me but show me deep down you prayin' (Ayy), ehh

Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now
Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now, yeah

You was in my corner, now you praying on my downfall
OG told me, \"Watch my circle the more I count em\"
Mines ain't never wrong, now I show em' to clear the past now
Facing this means cutting off ties cause I know this is bad for my
State of mind, watching every set cause you been sneak dissing
Throw dirt on my name because you hate the fact that my teeth glistening
Happy dreams I'm folding cause I grind and for these seat
I sit in beige leather, a top ten, either way I see it, I'm winning
You don't know what this life, but I could teach you to get it
You pride too high to hide, you rather hate me then be winning
But I don't want to give any more time
Hurts the heart of my soul and mind and

I be damned if I let anyone show
Show me all the signs if someone I don't want close
And it's hurting my soul
I honestly don't want to let go (Ayy)

Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now
Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now, yeah"),

(1,"Sad to The Bank",
"The money is stackin'
I been in the lab getting shots, about practice
Guess that's the reaction
You fall off the quickest, we blow up the fastest
Good thing I've been active, I been on my hustle, my bully my Casper
'Cause I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho
All I'm seein' is one comma, I need three of that
Two could do me plenty, every penny came from these hands
I don't really fuck with gossip, I don't need that
So I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho

Cryin' in tears and one day I'mma say we're the ones that I cried, that done got me this far
Ain't even trying still spit with a climate to highest and fire from here to the stars
When you this high, you get lonely, still I never found no coffee
She want me treat her like Rosie, put a ring around her finger
She usually like to move slowly
All eyes on me, cameras on me, farther I see then the farther I'm runnin'
If you with me, it's all in a leaf, you ain't ballin' if you ain't giving nothin'
It's why we ain't making room, no time to wait for you, uh-uh
We known to break the rules, I just tell fate to choose and I pray that

The money is stackin'
I been in the lab getting shots, about practice
Guess that's the reaction
You fall off the quickest, we blow up the fastest
Good thing I've been active, I been in my hustle, my bully my Casper
'Cause I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho
All I'm seein' is one comma, I need three of that
Two could do me plenty, every penny came from these hands
I don't really fuck with gossip, I don't need that
So I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho (Look)

Isolated, never jaded, I pray that the blessin's go all around
I don't need Lasik, to see they fakin', but send her my love, like feel shawty now
Your foot on the brake and you stallin', everybody movin' forward
Back in my mind where I leave you, but I know I'll never gon' need ya
So I will not say shit, when we touch down
We don't even ever have to talk but I'm sittin' on your playlist
Turn it up loud, barely catch me at the club 'cause I'm busy chasin' bucks
From the basement, to a bussdown
Where it's going but it ain't yet, it's a flood now
Let em' all say shit, gives a fuck about anything you say
Cause baby what nowâ€” and the-the-the-the

The money is stackin'
